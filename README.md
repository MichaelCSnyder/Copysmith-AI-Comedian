# Copysmith-AI-Comedian

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone repo
2. In the terminal, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
3. After containers are spun up, navigate to localhost:8080

## Notes

-   Due to time constraints, I didn't have time to implement a more sleek design
-   For the same reason, I wasn't able to containerize a local RDB instance or something similar
